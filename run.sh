# Runs the dev build with its output in logs/<name>.log, then prints the
# interesting bits: unresolved addresses, crashes, stubs it hit, and the
# watchdog's report if the game stopped responding. The switches a run needs
# are built into the exe (src/main.c, tl_default_env).
#
# Two gotchas this works around: PowerShell's Start-Process redirection
# drops output mid-line on this exe, and Git Bash's `timeout` leaves the exe
# running, so the run is ended with taskkill instead.
